My name is Mikayla Munn, I am an ambitious and driven remote instructor for computer coding and an exercise enthusiast. I thrive on challenges and constantly set goals for myself, so I have something to strive toward. I am  comfortable with pushing myself, and I am always looking for an opportunity to do better and achieve greatness, whether it is in the classroom or physical fitness, I enjoy learning something new and pushing my boundaries to become better. 

I am highly organized. I always take notes and use a series of tools to help myself stay on top of deadlines, such as a color coding system and using a Kanban board I developed on the computer. In my last role, I created a new labeling process that increased departmental efficiency by 75%. I like to keep a clean workspace and have a plan for the day so I know what needs to be accomplished, but I can adapt to change. I find this increases efficiency and helps the rest of the team stay on track, too. 

Currently I am a remote instructor, in order to be an effective teacher I must also be a student. I am learning different computer coding languages and brushing up on ones I have already learned, to effectively assist my students in being up to date on computer languages. In my free time, I enjoy spending time with my family, friends and giving back to my community
