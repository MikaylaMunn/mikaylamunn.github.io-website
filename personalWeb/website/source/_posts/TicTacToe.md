This app contains a game called tic tac toe. In this game the user will be asked to click a square. If the user clicks the square, an "X" or "O". Then their friend will be allowed to click a square and have "X" or "O" pop up.

The game will continue until one wins or there is a draw, meaning a tie. If the "X" wins, then the winner is "X" is displayed; same for "O".

There is also a reset button to reset the page to a blank game, but not the moves until a new game has started. In addition, the user can click the buttons generated after each move and see the moves happen.
