This app was a partner project and a forked repo designed for us to work on connecting our front end (HTML, CSS, Python) to the back end (Django).

If you click on any of the links they will take you to activities offered at the borough, for example if you clicked Brooklyn and this is what shows up. 

If you clicked the beaches, you come to a list of beaches offered in Brooklyn, similar to the home page.

If you have noticed on every page, there is a return home button. If you click that button, you will return home.
